# Bookbrooch

An app where users can save their favorite quotes, search for more quotes and play quote-related games.

## Project roles
Scrum - Yasien
DevOps - Sumithra
UX - Abdullah
QA - Manoela


## Set up 
Make sure you have Git and Node (v18) installed.

1. Use this template, clone your copy, `cd` into it
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the local dev server

Notes:
// Currently you can play the game only if you are logged out.
// Vercel is not updated

## User Stories

- [ ] As a user I want to be able to create a private profile so I can save my quotes privately.

- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to type a quote and add save to my page.

- [ ] As a user I want to be able to tag my quotes so I can organise them by theme.

- [ ] As a user I want to be able to sort quotes by category so I can keep them organised.

- [ ] As a user I want to have the option to play games related to quotes so I am more literate.

- [ ] As a user I will need some rewards and prompting to log new quotes regularly so I am more motivated to read.

- [ ] As a user who spends a lot of time in front of the screen, I want to view in dark mode so that I can protect my eyes.

- [ ] As a forgetful user, I'd like the application to be descriptive enough so I can navigate easier around it. 



- Why are you building it?

To fill the gap in the market since there does not currently exist (as far as we know) an app that integrates all the above functionality in one place (i.e. there are note apps and quote apps but no note-quote apps much less one that also has games).

## Project scope 

- What are you not building?



- How did you decide what features were important?

   We presented our idea to  different users, and we listened to the  feedback they gave. We prioritsed what most useers wanted to see in the app. Then We labelled all the tasks Low, Medium and High as a group.
   
## Project plan 
- How are you going to structure your sprints?



- What order are you going to build in?

- How did user research inform your plan?

## Requirement analysis 

- How will you ensure your project is accessible to as many users as possible?

- Are there any legal or regulatory requirements you should consider?

## Project learnings 

- Did your team work effectively?

- What would you do differently next time?


## Research and findings 
- What did you find out from user testing?
Users were interested in the idea. They liked the game feature and wanted to be able to share their quotes with their friends. They valued security and privacy. Also users thought that the app will improve their reading as they would be eager to save quotes. Most users agreed on the feature to tag quotes with a theme, so they can then sort their quotes by tag,

## Project outcomes 

- Were your assumptions right or wrong?

- Recommendations and conclusions 
- What features would you prioritise to build next?
- Was the project a success?

## Software Development Lifecycle stages 

### Planning 
- What roles did your team take on?

- Explain the roles and responsibilities of all people working within the software development lifecycle, and how they relate to the project (K2)

- Did these roles help your team work effectively?
- Outline how teams work effectively to produce software and how to contribute appropriately (K6) Compare and contrast the requirements of a software development team, and how they would ensure that each member (including themselves) were able to make a contribution (K6)

### Analysis 

- What might be the intended and unintended consequences of building this product?


### Design 

- How did you plan a user experience?

We designed a prototype of what we think the user would like to see and use on our app, then we conducted some user research and amended our features to reflect the feedback that we got.

- What technical decisions did you make?
we decided to use the following tech stack
React, NextJS, Sass, Firebase and Vercel

- Server-render vs client-render vs both
We are doing both Server and Client side rendering.

- Relational or non-relational or no DB

TBD

Relational DB

- Self-hosted or platform-as-a-service


- Frontend first vs DB first


- Did you create a technical specification?

- Review methods of software design with reference to functional/technical specifications and apply a justified approach to software development (K11, S11, S12)

### Implementation/Build 

- How did you ensure your code was good?
 
- Create logical and maintainable code to deliver project outcomes, explaining their choice of approach. (S1)

- What interesting technical problems did you have to solve?

- Outline and apply the rationale and use of algorithms, logic and data structures. (K9, S16)

- How did you debug issues that arose?
- Apply structured techniques to problem solving to identify and resolve issues and debug basic flaws in code (S7)

### Test 

- How did you verify your project worked correctly?
- Identify and create test scenarios which satisfy the project specification (S6)

- Did writing automated tests catch any bugs?
- Analyse unit testing results and review the outcomes, correcting errors. (S4)

### Deploy 

- Where/how did you deploy your application?
- Review and justify their contribution to building, managing and deploying code into the relevant environment in accordance with the project specification (S10)

- What problems did you encounter during deployment?

### Maintain 

- Is it easy for someone make changes to the codebase?
- Could a new person quickly be onboarded to contribute?
- Establishes a logical thinking approach to areas of work which require valid reasoning and/or justified decision making (B2)



- Describes how they have maintained a productive, professional and secure working environment throughout the project activity (B3)
